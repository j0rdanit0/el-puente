about.aboutUs.header=About Us
about.aboutUs.content=El Puente is the Spanish term for <em>the bridge</em>. El Puente Hispanic Services Center is a nonprofit <nobr>501(c)(3)</nobr> volunteer organization. The center works to improve the quality of life for the Hispanic individuals and families living in the Searcy, Arkansas area. We respect the Latino heritage and desire to assist Spanish speakers with assimilating into the community easier than otherwise would be possible. Stated simply, we want to be <em>the bridge</em> linking people with resources. We are a faith-based, non-denominational organization that primarily serves the Hispanic community, but does not refuse service to anyone in need. We believe in the concept of "freely you have received, freely give," which implies giving back and paying forward, all in an effort to strengthen our relationships in the Searcy community. We are all part of #MySearcy.
